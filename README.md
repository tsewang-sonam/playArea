### Steps to Run the App

Open Terminal  
Run this command to clone the repo - "https://github.com/tsewang-sonam/playArea.git"

Open the Project in Xcode  
Click the Run button (play icon) or press Cmd + R 

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I mainy focused on making sure to correctly implement swift concurrency and caching properly as i feel that it was the main focus of the project. 
Apart from that i also focused on implementing a search bar, which will play a huge factor in ease of use of the application to the user by filtering the specific
recipe that they are searching for.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I have spent about 8 hrs. I was working on another idea but then changes to table view for simplicity and desired outcome. I spent about 1.5 hours carefully reading the 
prompt and then thinking of ideas. The rest i used for coding and fixing bugs.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I have aimed for a simple UI and not implementing extra features. I was thinking of adding button for Youtube videos about recipe and also making a rating for the recipes but then 
i opted on focusing more in the main part which was swift concurrency and caching. With added feature like rating, video player and etc, i feel that project with look really good 
but given that i am already spenting more than 4 - 5 hours as project, so i stopped.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I was not able to implement the unit test properly and it was taking too long to figure out. That why i have decided to stop there and not taking more than 8 hours to finish the project.


### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I have implemented the error handling for different End point like malformed and emply recipe. Please comment out the desired url to run test in fetchData() as i was unable to finish
the unit test. Thank You.
